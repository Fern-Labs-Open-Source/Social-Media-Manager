# Test Repository

This file represents a test of GitHub tool functionality. It demonstrates the ability to create files and branches via API.

In a real-world scenario, we would be creating a separate repository, but due to permission constraints, we're creating this documentation file instead.

## Features Tested
- Branch creation
- File creation
- Repository access permissions

## Next Steps
This file can be removed once testing is complete.
